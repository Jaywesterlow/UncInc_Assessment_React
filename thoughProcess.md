# Train of thoughts

## Initial thoughts
Once I heard about the projects we were assigned to make, I immediately thought to myself to rush and learn as much about the basics of React as humanly possible (seeing as though I’ve never worked with React)  to get an understanding on how to start a basic project.
Once I started working I calmed down a bit thinking to myself to just take it one step at a time. 

## Problems
At first I followed the steps and whenever there was a problem, I searched the internet until I found out what caused it and how to fix it. The first big problem I encountered was the “jsx not allowed in files with extension '.js'” error. The online awnsers to this problem were unclear to me which caused me to believe there was an “eslint config” file somewhere in the “node_modules” folder. I struggled for a while before I eventually asking my classmate who regularly uses React and finally got the problem resolved.

## Working process
Knowing I had to make a paginator I had already done some research in my as soon as I’d gotten the assignment. I’d looked up video’s on how to make a paginator in react. I skipped through the video to see if it offers what i’m looking for. When I found the right video I saved it. 
Only after I managed to resolve the “jsx problem” I watched the full video carefully, trying to understand what i’m seeing and researching whatever I didn’t.
I then started testing the waters, trying to see what code I could change without breaking the page. I integrated bootstrap so I wouldn't have the added task of writing my own css. As for the React code itself, I mostly followed the video after I'd gained a basic understanding of hooks (specifically useState and useEffect).

## Final thoughts
Copying someone else's work obviously isn't something I make a habit of, however, given the quick out of the blue deadline we were given and the fact I had no knowledge whatsoever on writing code in React forced me into a possition where (in my eyes,) I had 3 options;
1. Give up (not really an option).
2. Spend day and night trying to get better at React and possibly end up with a sub-par product before the deadline. (however I would not have any time left for the laravel project)
3. Follow a video with the certainty the project will be finished in a reasonable amount of time (while also taking the time to understand why it works, instead of mindlessly copying).

## Ps.
I ended up still not having enough time to create the laravel project. I helped one of my fellow students with starting up the react project even though I'm aware we're essentially competitors in this situation.
